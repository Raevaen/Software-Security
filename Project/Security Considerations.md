Password Storage: Always hash passwords using a strong algorithm like bcrypt before storing them.

JWT Security: Store JWT tokens securely and implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms.

MetaMask Signatures: Ensure nonces are unique and expire after a short period to prevent replay attacks.

Smart Contract Access: Restrict smart contract functions to prevent unauthorized access.

Code Maintenance: Review all code, including with linting tools, to avoid vulnerabilities and consistently follow best programming practices.

Consider implementing true two-factor authentication (e.g. email code), since the public address is potentially accessible to everyone
